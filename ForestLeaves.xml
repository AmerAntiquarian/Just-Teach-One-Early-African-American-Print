                        <bibl>Psalm 68:31.</bibl>In the <bibl>Old Testament</bibl>, Ethiopia refers
                        not to the modern kingdom of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, but to an
                        ancient <placeName>Nubia</placeName>, the modern
                            <placeName>Sudan</placeName>. In its nineteenth-century usage, the term
                        "Ethiopian" referred more generally to people of African descent, rather
                        than to the region or nation of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>more
                        specifically. According to the <bibl>Oxford English Dictionary</bibl>, the
                        use of "Ethiop" to refer to " a black or dark-skinned person; a black
                        African" dates to as early as the fourteenth century. This use was also
                        prominent in other African American writing, as in that of
                            <persName>Harper's</persName> predecessor, <persName>Phillis
                            Wheatley</persName>, who refers to herself as "An Ethiop" in <bibl>To
                            the University of Cambridge, in New England" (1773)</bibl>

                    guardian of <persName>Esther</persName>, who becomes queen when she marries
                        <persName>King Ahasuerus</persName> (Xerxes 1 of
                        <placeName>Persia</placeName>). <persName>Haman</persName>, the grand
                    vizier, is infurieted that <persName>Mordecai</persName>, a Jew, refuses to bow
                    to do him obeisance on religious grounds. <persName>Haman</persName> therefore
                    plots not only to have <persName>Mordecai</persName> killed, but to exterminate
                    all Jews in the <placeName>Persian Empire</placeName>.<persName>Queen
                        Esther</persName>, who is herself Jewish, informs the king of
                        <persName>Mordecai</persName>'s service to him and
                        <persName>Haman</persName>'s plot and petitions him to save the lives of her
                    people. <persName>Haman</persName> throws himself upon
                        <persName>Esther</persName>'s couch to plead with her for his own life, but
                    the king takes this as an assault. <persName>Ahasuerus</persName> ultimately has
                        <persName>Haman</persName> hanged on the gallows that
                        <persName>Haman</persName> had prepared for <persName>Mordecai</persName>.
                        <persName>Mordecai</persName> is appointed grand vizier and the king gives
                    the Jews permission to slaughter their enemies. This deliverance of Persian Jews
                    from <persName>Haman</persName>'s plot establishes the Jewish feast of Purim. </note>

                <note xml:id="n019" target="#a019"> Naomi moves from Bethlehem to Moab with her
                    husband and sons, one of whom marries Ruth, a Moabite woman. Naomi’s husband and
                    sons (including Ruth’s husband) die and Naomi prepares to return to Bethlehem.
                    Ruth chooses to remain with her mother-in-law and works to support her, rather
                    than returning to her own people. Ruth’s marriage to Mahlon is considered a
                    “mixed” marriage because Ruth is a Moabite and Naomi and her family are Jewish.
                    This makes Ruth’s decision to remain with her mother-in-law even more
                    significant (Ruth 1:9-22). Ruth goes on to marry Boaz, a wealthy landowner and
                    relation of Naomi’s late husband. King David is one of their descendants
                    (<bibl style="font­-style: italic">Ruth 2:1-4:22</bibl>). Watkins revised this poem for the 1857 edition

                       Jesus' healing powers appears in the three synoptic
                    gospels, in which Jesus raises Jairus'
                    daughter from the dead and heals a woman who had suffered for twelve years with
                    a hemorrhage (<bibl style="font­-style: italic">Matthew 9:18-26; Mark 5:21-43</bibl>). In the
                    gospel of Luke, the healed woman’s words are different than in the other two
                    synoptic gospels (<bibl style="font­-style: italic">Luke 8:40-56</bibl>). Harper

                <figDesc>A woodcut of a park, with three monuments visible in the foreground. One is
                    centered, and has a prominent shield as part of its decoration. Five figures are
                    depicted also, strolling in the park. Two on the left-hand side are in
                    conversation, facing away from the viewer. The three on the right-hand side are
                    also discussing something, and one is gesturing to the monument.</figDesc>
